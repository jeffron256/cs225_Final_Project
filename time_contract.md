# Team Contract

## Communication
**1.** **Team Meetings** 

We plan to meet at least twice a week, and the duration would be around two hours for each meeting. Our development tool was based on WSL, Vscode, and GitHub as version control. Yifan Li will record the vital information for the discussion and share it with the group chat of the final project.

**2.** **Assistance** 

We have a group chat that we can use to contact each other. If anyone has a question, they can share it in the group. The expected response time is around 1hr except at midnight. When we encounter over-complicated technical problems which we cannot solve by ourselves, we will go to OH and look for help from Profs or TAs.

**3.** **Respect** 

We will always be patient while listening to others’ opinions. Furthermore, in case of equality, we will respect every group member’s religion, race, gender, and nationality. No ANY discrimination or dictatorship is allowed in our group. 

## Collaboration

**4.** **Work Distribution** 

Everyone in the group is willing to contribute their best to the project, so the workload is based on each member's weekly schedule, and we will make sure each member's overall tasks will be roughly equal. 

**5.** **Time Commitment** 

We plan to work on the project for at least two hours per week, and the actual time duration depends on each member’s schedule. If one’s schedule conflicts with the meeting time for unforeseen circumstances, we will inform other group members on the group chat and choose a new timeslot. Also, after each group meeting, we will accomplish everyone’s parts of the projects and be prepared for the next meeting. 

**6.** **Conflict Resolution** 

When two of our members have conflict with each other, first we will try to relieve both sides emotionally, then we can ask the group member who stands neutral to judge the choice. Or if it’s a technical problem, we would also consult the faculties during office hours. If one of the team member has not accomplished the task or is habitually late, the other members will first friendly remind that person in case he or she is unintentional or just too busy these days, but if the team member has done this several times and unwilling to listen to other team members, we will have to inform the staff.
